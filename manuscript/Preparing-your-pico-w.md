# Preparing your Pico W

## Getting familiar with the Pico W

You'll need to know your way around the Pico.

When it arrives, your Pico W will probably look like this.

Here are the front and back of the board:

Here's an annotated image of the front.

1. The two lines of holes at the top and bottom of the board are for power and GPIO (General Purpose I/O) 
connections. You'll solder header pins in those holes.
2. The connector at the side is the USB port which you'll connet to your hsot computer when you want to program the 
   Pico W.
3. The button marked `bootsel` is used to put the Pico in to bootsel mode. You'll use that when you need to install 
   or re-install MicroPython.

There are two things you'll need to do to prepare your Pico W for use.

The first is to install MicroPython on your Pico W. If you've done this before for the original Pico, the process is 
the same, but you will need to make sure you use the correct version of MicroPython. The version for the original Pico 
lacks the features you will need to connect to the Internet.

## Installing MicroPython

You'll find simple, clear instructions on the
[Raspberry Pi Website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html)

Next, you'll need to solder the headers.
