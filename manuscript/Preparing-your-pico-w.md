# Preparing your Pico W

## Getting familiar with the Pico W

You'll need to know your way around the Pico.

When it arrives, your Pico W will probably look like this.

Here are the front and back of the board:

Here's an annotated image of the front.

1. The two lines of holes at the top and bottom of the board are for power and GPIO (General Purpose I/O) 
connections. You'll solder header pins in those holes.
2. The connector at the side is the USB port which you'll connect to your host computer when you want to program the 
   Pico W.
3. The button marked `bootsel` is used to put the Pico in to bootsel mode. You can use that when you need to install 
   or re-install MicroPython, although you'll also learn an alternative approach.

There are three things you'll need to do to prepare your Pico W for use.

1. Install the software you'll be using on your computer
2. Install MicroPython on the Pico W
3. 

The se is to install MicroPython on your Pico W. If you've done this before for the original Pico, the process is 
the same, but you will need to make sure you **use the correct version of MicroPython**. The version for the original Pico 
lacks the features you will need to connect to the Internet.

## Installing MicroPython

You'll need to 
1. Download the [latest version](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/rp2-pico-w-latest.uf2) of MicroPython for 
   the Pico W from the MicroPython Website. Save the `uf2` file and make a note of the location where you saved the 
   file.
