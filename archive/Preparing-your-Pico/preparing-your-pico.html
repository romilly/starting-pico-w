<h1>Preparing your Pico W</h1>

<p>If you've met the Pico before, you'll probably know abut soldering headers and programming the Pico from your computer.</p>

<p>It's still worth reading the section <em>Save time with mpremote</em>. <code>mpremote</code> is useful program from the MicroPyton team that can simplify installation and testing of MicroPython and the code you write for it.</p>

<h2>Getting familiar with the Pico W</h2>

<p>You'll need to know your way around the Pico.</p>

<p>When it arrives, your Pico W will probably look like this.</p>

<p>Here are the front and back of the board:</p>

<p>Here's an annotated image of the front.</p>

<li>The two lines of holes at the top and bottom of the board are for power and GPIO (General Purpose I/O) 
connections. You'll need to solder header pins in those holes.</li>
<li>The connector at the side is the USB port which you'll connect to your host computer when you want to program the 
Pico W.</li>
<li>The button marked <code>bootsel</code> is used to put the Pico in to bootloader mode. You can use that when you need to install 
or re-install MicroPython, although you'll also learn an alternative approach below.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Detailed preparations</h2>

<p>There are three things you'll need to do to prepare to program your Pico W.</p>

<ol>
<li>Solder headers to the Pico W if it doesn't have them already. While you don't need headers to run code on your Pico, you will need them if you want to use a breadboard or add-on peripheral to connect your Pico to the outside world</li>
<li>Install the software you'll be using on your computer</li>
<li>Install MicroPython on the Pico W</li>
</ol>

<h3>Soldering the headers</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, you'll find advice on soldering, including the hardware you need, in the
<a href="https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/the-ultimate-guide-to-soldering">Pimoroni Soldering Guide</a> and the Adafruit 
<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering">guide to soldering</a>. </p>

<p>There's also a guide that covers soldering Pico headers in <a href="">Get started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico</a>.</p>

<p>If you're new to soldering, you'll need to take extra care to check for dry joints (where the solder doesn't make a 
good electrical connection) and solder bridges (where the solder connects things where it shouldn't). You'll see relevant advice in the guides.</p>

<p>I find that a good lamp with a magnifier works really well for checking soldering before I apply any power. It seems the model below is no longer available, but there are plenty of great alternatives; just search for <em>Magnifying Lamp</em>.</p>

<h2>Preparing your main computer</h2>

<p>You'll need an editor on your main computer. It's possible to use any text editor, but most Pico owners use an editor 
called <code>Thonny</code>.</p>

<p>Thonny has good support for MicroPython, and it works very well with the Pico and Pico W. It's pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi OS, but you'll need to amke sure you have a recent version of the Operating System 
installed. Bullseye is fine, but some earlier version had a version of Thonny that lacked support fo the Pico.</p>

<p>You'll see how to install Thonny on other operating systems below.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use another editor, that's fine, but this guide will assume that you're using Thonny. You'll find a discussion of the pros and cons of 
some popular editors in Appendix A, along with additional explanation of how you can then install and run your code on the Pico.</p>

<p>Whichever editor you use, I strongly recommend that you also install a program called <code>mpremote</code>. As you'll see 
later, <code>mpremote</code> can simplify a lot of tasks when you're installing, developing or debugging software on your Pico.</p>

<h3>Installing Thonny</h3>

<p>Thonny comes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS, but you need to install it if you're using a Windows, macOS or other 
Linux computer. You'll find installation instructions some way down the <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny home page</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using version 3.3.14. That or later versions work well with the Pico.</p>

<h3>Installing Python 3</h3>

<p>If you want to use <code>mpremote</code> you'll also need Python 3 on your main computer. You'll find advice about installing 
Python on the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python website</a>. </p>

<h3>Installing mpremote</h3>

<p>If you have a full installation of Python 3 on your computer, you can install <code>mpremote</code> by typing <code>pip3 install 
mpremote</code> in a command window</p>

<p>You'll find details of how to use <code>mpremote</code> on its
<a href="https://docs. micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html">main documentation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing MicroPython</h2>

<p>Finally, you'll need to install MicroPython on your Pico W. If you've done this before for the original Pico, the 
same process will work, but you will need to make sure you <strong>use the correct version of MicroPython</strong>. The version for 
the original Pico lacks the features you will need to connect to the Internet.</p>

<h3>Install MicroPython the standard way</h3>

<p>You'll need to 
1. Download the <a href="https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/rp2-pico-w-latest.uf2">latest version</a> of MicroPython for 
   the Pico W from the MicroPython Website. Save the <code>uf2</code> file and make a note of the location where you saved it.
2. If you've already installed a version of MicroPython, you'll need to press the <em>bootsel</em> button on the Pico W. (The 
   <em>bootsel</em>button was featured in an earlier diagram.)
3. Plug the USB cable in to connect the Pico W to your computer
4. If you pressed it, release the <em>bootsel</em> button. A new external drive called RP2- will appear.
5. Drag or copy the <code>uf2</code> file onto the external drive. After a few seconds the drive will disappear. Your Pico 
   W is now ready for some MicroPython programming.</p>

<h3>Save time when rebooting</h3>

<p>The <em>bootsel</em> button is small, and can be hard to reach if you have headers on top of the Pico for some reason. Also, 
it's a nuisance having to unplug and replug the USB cable.</p>

<p>Luckily there are two easy ways to put the Pico into bootloader mode.</p>

<p>The first is to use the mpremote program mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you run <code>mpremote bootloader</code> on the host computer it wil put your Pico into bootloader mode, allowing you to 
copy a <code>.uf2</code> file onto the storage device that appears.</p>

<p>The second method requires you to use a <em>REPL</em> - a Read-Evaluate-Print_Loop session that lets you execute MicroPython 
code on your Pico. You'll see how to enter and use a REPL in the section that follows.</p>

<p>You've soldered the headers, installed a suitable editor, and copied MicroPython onto your Pico.</p>

<p>Now it's time to check that everything is working.</p>

<h2>Check your installation</h2>

<p>This section assumes that you're using the Thonny editor. If you're using another editor, Appendix A explains how to 
install and run MicroPython code on your Pico.</p>

<p>You'll probably still have your Pico connected to your main computer with your USB cable. If not, connect them now.</p>

<h3>Start Thonny</h3>

<p>Start Thonny. It should show a screen line this:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.rareschool.com/img/8e305be2-1a36-11ed-99c1-61a7fad8dd76-thonny-01.png" alt="image" title="" /></p>

<p>The line in the lower screen that reads 
<code>MicroPython v1.19.1 on 2022-08-08; Raspberry Pi Pico W with RP2040</code>
shows you that Thonny has found and connected to your Pico. and it
tells you the version of MicroPython that's running on the Pico.</p>

<p>If you type <code>2+2</code> and press <code>Enter</code> in Thonny's lower pane, you'll see the answer <code>4</code>  appear. That pane contains 
Thonny's <code>REPL</code>. It allows you to enter and execute MicroPython expressions, and see the result if there is one.</p>

<p>The <code>REPL</code> is really useful for testing code.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>You've soldered headers on your Pico/Pico W, you've installed the software you need on your computer, and you've 
installed and verified MicroPython on the Pico.</p>

<p>You'll program the Pico using MicroPython, which is an implementation of versions 3 of the Python 
language. It contains almost all of Python 3 language features, and implements a useful subset of Python 3's 
standard library.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 <em>Learn Basic Python</em> looks at ways of getting up to speed with Python. If you're already 
familiar with Python you can skip straight to chapter 4 <em>Programing your Pico</em>.</p>
