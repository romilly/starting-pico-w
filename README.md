# Content for 'Make MicroPython Projects with the Pi Pico W'

# Should you read this guide?

If you're familiar with Python  and you want to start using the Raspberry Pi Pico W, this guide is for you.

It will be a short, free ebook in PDF format. You can give it to your friends, and I hope you do!

It's a work in progress. I'll post about updates on the website, in [my blog](https://blog.rareschool.com/)
and as [@RAREblog](https://twitter.com/rareblog) on Twitter.

I'm moving chapters from here to Google Drive as they are ready for review, but I'll add pdfs of each draft chapter here as they are ready. You'll find them in the `pdfs` directory under the project root.
