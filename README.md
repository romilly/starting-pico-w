# Should you read this guide?

If you're familiar with Python  and you want to start using the Raspberry Pi Pico W, this guide is for you.

It's a short, free ebook in PDF format. You can give it to your friends, and I hope you do!

It's a work in progress. I'll post about updates on the website, in [my blog](https://blog.rareschool.com/)
and as [@RAREblog](https://twitter.com/rareblog) on Twitter.
