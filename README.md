# Content for Powering Python Projects with the Pi Pico W

# Should you read this ebook?

If you're familiar with Python  and you want to start using the new Raspberry Pi Pico W, this guide is for you.

It's a short, free ebook in PDF format.

It's a work in progress. I'll post about updates on the website, in [my blog](https://blog.rareschool.com/)
and as [@RAREblog](https://twitter.com/rareblog) on Twitter.
